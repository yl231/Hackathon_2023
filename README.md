About us:
We are a group of four CS majored students from Rice, inspired by the rapid development of AI and severe need in accessing medical resources. Nearly all of our group members experienced difficulties in accessing basic medical resource, for example, making appointment with dentists or asking simple question on the internet like "when should I stop coughing after getting COVID-19?". Stemming from this, our goal is to improve individual's experience in accessing medical resources. Therefore, we built a medical trials search engine and combine it with AI aimming to bridging medical needed to correct trials and common people to professional medical expertise. 

How to use:
To run the program, you need to have python installed. First, run the "app.py" file. This will build a server that enables LLM to execute on a virtual machine on the cloud and opens the corresponding web page. On the web page, we have the following functionalities:
1. Users can search by keyword to find the relevant medical trials they need. They can also utilize advanced search to minimize the search range to reflect more accurate need.
2. Users can use the Medical AI Tool for specific medical questions. This aims to solve the pain that a simple medical question doesn't worth a doctor visit but cause lots of pain if not solved.
3. Users can use the dynamically loaded glossory for medical terms as common people that don't quite have the expertise in understanding them.
